### Your chosen game 

a tamagatchi (virtual pet) style game where your pet is a plant or a cactus.
the purpose of the game is to grow your plant friend to a mature plant without  without accidentally killing it.


### Basic User stories

choose your seed - random choice between plant or cactus
grow your plant

stages of plant and cactus
- seed
- seedling
- seedling with leaves
- baby plant
- mature plant

grow your plant from a seed into its mature form
each stage becomes harder with each turn
each turn requires a command

ATTRIBUTES

A plant requires different things than the cactus.

the two commands are 
getWater & getSun

if your plant friend gets too much water or sun it may rot.

A cactus requires less water but require alot of sun. having too much shade can cause your plant to die.

a plant requires frequent watering but too much can cause rot.
plants require sun and shade. too much sun can cause it to dry.

### Anything else your instructional team should know
I plan to use two builds for plant and for cactus
they will have two attributes 

nutrients = water 
health = sun

getWater will raise nutrients but if option is chosen too many times it will cause your pet to die

getSun will raise its health but having too much sun will cause it to dry

4 getWater commands in a row will cause your plant to die 

2 getWater commands in a row will cause your cactus to die

get sun command is needed for cactus, if cactus doesnt get sun in 4 turns it will die

if getSun is used on plant for 3 turns in a 4 turn loop then your plant will die

work through the stages to reach maturity of pet.

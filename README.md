PAIN POINTS / GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

This project was difficult and fun at the same time.
it left me between super productive when it came time to work on CSS and also spent way too much time being lost in CSS.

Overall, with all the CSS time that was spent the more I realized that I really enjoy that aspect of the project.

JS on the other hand was something that I was scared to figure out since I still didnt feel confident with my function skills.

I was scared to ask for help because I also didnt know what exactly I was trying to do.
I did research and watched tutorials on how to implement something and by the end of the project I knew what I exactly I was looking for rather than just being completely lost. 

I spent hours working on a progress bar / health bar and in the end and with the help of classmates and instructors, I found something else that I liked even more.

CSS was my pain point in the end because I never did find out how to line things up exactly how I wanted. but everything else was an amazing growth opportunity and in a week of working independently I've come to learn alot from learning from making mistakes.

Welcome to "Plant Friend"

This is a virtual pet style game, where the only need for a pet here is either a plant or cactus. 

Some pets are way to hard to take care of so why not try a plant? have you already tried and manage to kill that too? then why not try a cactus?

In this game, we made it more simplistic to take care of your plant friend.

We made it harder to kill your plant but not impossible, so treat your plant friend well.

Depending on your choice between plant or cactus, you may find that they require different kind of care.
